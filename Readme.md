RaspAstro

Just a place to put some of my Raspberry Pi Astronomy Stuff


build_hubble2.sh - Updates the raspberry pi, configures GPSD, some RPi optimizations, and  installs indi-core, indi-3rdparty drivers and libraries, and phd2

install-indi-driver.sh - Installs an indi-3rdparty driver or library based on user input.  Helpful to adding new indi drivers after initial build.
